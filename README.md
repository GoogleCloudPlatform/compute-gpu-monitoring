# Google Compute Engine GPU Monitoring

This repository hosts an example script that
can be used to monitor GPU utilization parameters
on GCE instances.

The recommended way to monitor GPU utilization on Linux virtual machine (VM) instances
is by using version `2.38.0` or later of the [Ops Agent](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/monitor-gpus).
